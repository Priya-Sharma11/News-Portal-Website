    Your website is your most visible and valuable marketing asset and the decision as to which content management system (CMS) to use when building your site can have a long-term impact on the success of your organization. Today’s CMS solutions are at the epicenter of your marketing technology stack and are key factors in driving revenue, brand awareness, and engagement with prospects and customers. Finding a solution that can be tailored to support the needs of your business is more important than ever.

And remember, you’re not just choosing technology. The vendor of that technology is an essential part of your decision. Do they see the needs of your market the way you do and are they working on a product roadmap that will support your organization going forward? Or are they focused on features you don’t really need and will just serve to clutter the product you’re using. Is there even a vendor? Open source solutions may seem great — but if you require any support, you may not have an obvious place to turn to when you need it.</h6>

     fontFamily:'sans-serif'}}>Optimizely, Sitecore, Contentful, Drupal, Webflow, WordPress, and a host of other solutions make up a crowded CMS market that you’ll have to evaluate. These platforms are not one-size-fits-all—each solution offers compelling features and functionality. They also have trade-offs that include cost, ease of use, and ability to integrate with back-office systems.

A new CMS is a big decision for any company, as it’s the critical centerpiece of a modern marketing technology stack. It’s the revenue engine in the era of the connected consumer—and it’s the kind of decision that can make or break a career.

We have some factors to weigh when you're selecting a CMS that's the best fit for your business.</p>

     }}>
<h3 >1. Cost of the CMS System</h3>
<p >First and foremost, you need to know what your budget looks like for the CMS and consider factoring in licensing costs, implementation, updates, upgrades, and optimization.

The CMS you choose will be a cornerstone for your business, so you'll want to avoid cutting corners just to save a few bucks. CMS pricing ranges anywhere from free (with open-source systems like Drupal) to up to six figures in annual licensing fees for some enterprise solutions.

Remember that return on investment is always a relative measure. The higher cost is not always worth it, just like the lower cost isn’t always taking the easy way out. What is your business success worth, and what will it take to make that happen? As noted above, each platform comes with its strengths and weaknesses, but investing in a CMS that has loads of features you don’t (and won’t) need is a surefire way to increase costs needlessly.

Understanding your investment tolerance and how it intersects with your usage requirements is an important first step in aligning with the right technical solution.</p>
<h3>2. Business Requirements</h3>
<p >Strike a balance that meets your business's requirements without overspending or underdelivering. To accomplish that, start by going beyond a superficial understanding of what a CMS can offer and determine precisely what your company needs. To make an informed decision, dive into your business's unique requirements.

Consider whether you need robust commerce features or integration with a specific CRM. Also, think about whether personalization or automation is core to your business strategy. Some CMS platforms have native digital marketing capabilities and customer experience management features, but others may require third-party integrations.

Sitecore and Optimizely, for example, provide toolsets and features for companies that need to focus on interactive content management. Consider third-party integrations and developer plugins for platforms that are light on native tools. The more specific you can make your usage scenarios, the easier it will be to evaluate different CMS platforms and their feature sets.</p>
<h3 >3. CMS Platform Ease of Use</h3>
<p >A CMS platform separates design, management, and content publishing from coding and technical management. The ease of use for non-technical teams is just as important as for the end-user experience. Enabling your organization to manage and update content easily will help drive a meaningful boost in productivity and efficiency.

There are extreme ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ease of use on a CMS platform. On one end, you have solutions that are almost entirely run on what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interfaces. These platforms may not have all the flexibility you need, but you can be sure that just about any business user will be able to make content updates efficiently.

On the other end, you have complex, high-functioning systems that may have steeper learning curves but also offer great benefits for the right organization that is staffed to manage them. Drupal, for example, is known for its flexibility and security. However, the open-source platform presents challenges for less-technical business users to overcome.</p>

<h3 >4. SEO Friendliness</h3>
<p>Search engine optimization is one of the most significant advantages of using a CMS platform. Understanding how a CMS handles new URL creation, unique titles and meta descriptions, and integration with powerful SEO tools can benefit your personalization and content strategy.

However, SEO friendliness is no longer just about written content. With the rise of voice technology, you ensure your CMS can support search engine optimization in more conversational channels.</p>

<h3>5. Level of Personalization</h3>
<p>Consumers today expect personalized experiences. In a recent study, 59% of consumers think businesses should use the data you collect on them to personalize their experiences. And with a personalized experience they're more likely to become repeat buyers.

Enabling personalization requires businesses to obtain data from various systems working together, including customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and more. But beyond the data, the CMS also needs to enable the effective delivery of personalized experiences. That could include dynamic banners and retargeting content based on user behavior or user attributes.</p>
